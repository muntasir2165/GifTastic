# GifTastic

A browser-based JavaScript and jQuery app that will query the Giphy API and dynamically update webpages with gifs of the queried term.

## Project Motivation

This app was developed as part of the APIs & AJAX homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project is a testament to the mastery of advanced JavaScript and jQuery concepts that included using third party APIs and AJAX calls which ultimately resulted in an app that is simple yet powerful in its features. The app also persists the user's choice of gifs using Local Storage on the browser allowing for some lightweight customization.

## Getting Started

Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine and open index.html using a browser. When the page loads up, press "Start Game" and enjoy!
